ElGamal encryption algorithm 
Generates a public key and private key for encryption and decryption 
Encryption: Takes input from user as an integer and encrypts it into ciphertext (c1,c2) 
The program is then able to Decrypt the ciphertext and output the message entered 
it decrypts using private key.
Prime number generation: generates a large prime number to add a level of security making the public key harder to guess
base generator primitive root function that checks if a the base generator is a primitive root modulus p 
primitive root detection, finds the primitive roots required for the encryption process
